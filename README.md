# Working with both Proprietary and Open Source Software (3089)
In 2018, Ernestynne delivered one of the top-rated presentations at the SAS® Users New Zealand conference. The presentation talked about a future of working with both open-source and proprietary software. It covered the benefits and provided some examples of combining both. The future is now here. This 90-minute Hands-On Workshop drills down into examples that were briefly touched on during that presentation. Attendees get a taste of working with R in SAS® Enterprise Miner™ and some general best practice tips. There is an introduction to the Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer (SWAT) package, which enables you to interface with SAS® Viya® in open-source languages like R. This presentation briefly covers avoiding some traps that you can fall into when working with the SWAT package. The techniques learned here can be extended to enable you to work with Python in SAS®. The emphasis of this Hands-On Workshop is how to combine SAS with open-source tools, rather than teaching attendees how to code in R.

### Requirements
**Images and software**
This workshop has been tested on the following images and software

*** Enterprise Miner ***
Software Version: SAS 9.4 M4, EM 14.2
Image Name: EDU\_EM\_FS94M4

*** R Studio and R ***
Software Version: R Studio 1.1.456, R 3.5.1 "Feather Spray"
Image Name: EDU_Viya33Analytics

**** R packages ****
randomForest (4.6-12)
swat (1.3.0)

as well as all their dependencies

**Other**
Internet access so that attendees can look at the online data dictionary

### Known Issues
1. The authinfo file is not populated on EDU_Viya33Analytics
2. Originally, `./exercises/Ex-2-3.xml` had the solution in the Code Editor of the open source integration node. This has been fixed by directly editing the xml file but has not been tested during a diagram import into Enterprise Miner. If this causes issues then the original xml file can be retrieved from[https://github.com/nicholson-consulting/sgf-workshop/blob/4172faf691bb5652e3d84af60ae7312cabf5b331/exercises/Ex-2-3.xml](here). The EM project submit text file code has also been updated.

### Installation
1. Create the directory `D:/Workshop/HOW`
2. Create file `D:/Workshop/HOW/cas_crash.csv` this can be done using the link in `./data/CAS-metadata.txt` or accessing the zipped csv file if you access to it. Warning using the link means that you will have the latest version of the data not the version that the workshop was built on
3. Run `./startup/autoexec.sas` and confirm that the output you get is the same as `./startup/autoexec.html`
4. Open up `./solutions/Ex-4-Solution.R`, read the dependencies and notes. Once you have sorted out the dependencies and the notes you can run the script and confirm that you get `./results/Ex-4.out`
5. An Enterprise Miner Project is required. A zipped EM project can be provided on request in which case carry on at step 10. Alternatively, one can be created from scratch by following the subsequent steps
6. Create the EM Project. The project name is `HOW-Open-Source-Integration`, directory is `D:/Workshop/HOW`, the default metadata server and default application server can be used
7. Create a library called `how` that points to `D:/Workshop/HOW`
8. Create the data source. The file you will choose is `cas_crash.sas7bdat` use all the default settings up to step 4. At step 4 check the `advanced` metadata option. At step 5 you will need to change the role of `OBJECTID` to an `ID` then you can accept all the other defaults and hit next until you can hit finish
9. Import the diagrams `./exercises/Ex-1.xml`, `./solutions.Ex-1-Solution.xml`, `./exercises/Ex-2-3.xml` and `./solutions/Ex-2-3-Solution.xml`
10. Open `./solutions/Ex-1-Solution.xml` and run the diagram. Confirm that you get the results listed in `./solutions/Ex-1.log`
11. Open `./solutions/Ex-2-3-Solution.xml` and run the diagram. Confirm that you get the results listed in `./solutions/Ex-2.log` and `./solutions/Ex-3.log`
12. Open `./exercises/Ex-2-3.xml` and run the nodes **prior** to the R randomForest open source integration node
